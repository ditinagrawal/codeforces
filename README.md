# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces competitive programming problems.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by problem number and division:

- `A_X.java` - Division A problems
- `B_X.java` - Division B problems (if any)
- `C_X.java` - Division C problems (if any)

Where `X` represents the contest/problem number.

## Language

All solutions are implemented in **Java**.

## How to Run

To compile and run any solution:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

For example:

```bash
javac A_1.java
java A_1
```

## About

These solutions are written for competitive programming practice on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Each file contains the solution code along with the original problem statement in comments.

## Note

Solutions may not always be the most optimal, as they were written during practice sessions and contests with time constraints.
